# **Synthetic Aviation Fuel Modeling Tool**

## **Overview**

This repository provides a modeling tool designed to evaluate the cost and resource requirements for producing synthetic aviation fuel from captured carbon dioxide to meet Canada’s monthly jet fuel demand between 2019 and 2050. The analysis covers six provinces: Alberta (AB), British Columbia (BC), Manitoba (MB), New Brunswick (NB), Ontario (ON) and Quebec (QC).

Four fuel demand growth scenarios are defined in the main script. The tool generates monthly output data from January 2019 (minimum demand index: 85) to December 2050 (maximum demand index: 468), which are stored in the designated “output” directory.

At the core of the repository is the main_FO module, which computes material requirements for each selected scenario based on inputs from several process units, each modeled in a separate matlab file:

    - Co-electrolysis
    - Fischer–Tropsch synthesis
    - Autothermal reformer
    - Hydrocracker

The Levelized Cost of Jet Fuel (LCOJF) is then calculated in the 'LCOJF' module.

## **Folder Structure**

* `Co-Electrolysis.m` 
* `FischerTropsch.m`
* `ATR.m` 
* `Hydrocracker.m` 
* `Main.m`
* `fuel\_demand\_FO.m`
* `LCOJF.m`
* `**Input/**`
* `**Output/**`

> **Note:** 
### Source Files


- `MonthlyATFConsumption.m`  
  Contains monthly ATF consumption fractions.
- `ProvAirportsMvts.m`  
  Optional: Allocates fuel across provinces using aircraft movement data.

### Output Folders

*  **FedFuelProduction/**

Spreadsheets for process streams and requirements generated by `Main.m`

* **CDF/**

Monte Carlo distributions for LCOJF for each fuel demand growth scenario.

* **LCOJF/**

Levelized cost results for each scenario.

## **Instructions**

1. Ensure all file names match those referenced within the scripts

2. Run `main.m` and enter a temperature value (100–1000°C) when prompted. This can be set constant or varied over time; select Y/N when prompted. The default scenario uses `2.5x` growth. For other scenarios, change the scenario array index at the start of the main loop.

3. The main module executes the fuel demand module first, producing monthly CO₂ requirements for the electrolyzer based on projected fuel demand and growth scenarios.

4. After running the initial scenario, go to the `output/FedFuelProduction/` folder and take note of the timestamp at the end of the filenames you want to use as input for the LCOJF module (the timestamp appears after the final underscore `_`).  Then, replace the value on line 65 of `LCOJF.m` with this timestamp to ensure the correct input file is referenced.
